# OIBSIP-Project-3----ATM-Interface
Project Title task 3 : ATM Interface Simulation
Project Overview:
The ATM Interface Simulation is a Java-based console application designed to emulate the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project offers users a comprehensive banking experience, including account registration, balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, deposits, fund transfers, and transaction history tracking.

Features:
User Registration:

Users can register by providing their name, username, password, and account number.
Registration is a prerequisite to accessing the ATM functionalities.
Login:

After registration, users can log in to the system by verifying their username and password.
Cash Withdrawal:

Users can withdraw cash from their account, with the system ensuring that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the available balance.
Successful withdrawals are recorded in the transaction history.
Cash Deposit:

Users can deposit cash into their account, with the deposited amount being added to the current balance.
The deposit is recorded in the transaction history.
Fund Transfer:

Users can transfer funds to another account by specifying the recipient's account number and the transfer amount.
The transfer amount is deducted from the user's balance, and the transaction is recorded in the history.
Balance Inquiry:

Users can check their current account balance at any time.
Transaction History:

The system maintains a record of all transactions (withdrawals, deposits, and transfers) performed by the user.
Users can view their transaction history to review their past activities.
Exit:

Users can safely exit the application at any point.
